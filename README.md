### Interpretable Multi-label classification learning for Type 2 Diabetes Risk Factor Discovery from the UKBiobank
Health disparities

We need to understand if there are health disparities between different ethnic groups in the context of diabetes. For example, if there is a clinical factor/genetic factor that has a higher importance in one ethnic group than in a another for diabetic patients. To understand how different features contribute to produce the right prediction depending on the ethnic group, we can:

Mutli-label feature selection approach - We tried multi-label classification approach, when a patient will have attributed both EthnicGroup and disease_status as classification class. The model will try to predict both attributes simultaneously and deduce the importance of certain factors by feature selection
